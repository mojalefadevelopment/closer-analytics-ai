Coach: Glad you’re here. What’s the hardest part of your high-ticket calls right now?
Coachee: I get a lot of interest, but near the end it stalls with “I’ll think about it.”
Coach: When does that happen most?
Coachee: When we get to price and timing. It gets vague.
Coach: What do you usually say in that moment?
Coachee: I tell them to take their time and that I’ll follow up later.
Coach: What do you think that signals?
Coachee: That I’m not confident or that there’s no urgency.
Coach: What do you need to steer it with more direction?
Coachee: Clarity on whether they’re the decision maker and what deadline they’re working with.
Coach: How do you check decision making now?
Coachee: I ask who else is involved, but I leave it there.
Coach: What’s a sharper question you can ask?
Coachee: “If we agree today, who still needs to say yes?”
Coach: And how do you make timing more concrete?
Coachee: “When do you need this live by, and what happens if that doesn’t happen?”
Coach: What do you do if price is the blocker?
Coachee: I re-explain the value, but I don’t probe deeper.
Coach: What question helps you get the real objection?
Coachee: “What makes this feel difficult to decide right now?”
Coach: And if they say they need to discuss it internally?
Coachee: I schedule a follow-up, but I don’t make sure the right person is on it.
Coach: What will you do differently?
Coachee: I’ll ask to schedule the next call with all decision makers.
Coach: What’s your ideal next step after a good call?
Coachee: A concrete decision call with a date and agenda, or schedule kickoff right away.
Coach: How do you close when they’re almost ready?
Coachee: “Should we wrap this up today and plan kickoff?”
Coach: How could you make that more specific?
Coachee: “If we finalize this now, your team starts next week. Want to lock that in?”
Coach: What do you need to do this consistently?
Coachee: A short checklist: decision maker, timing, impact, next step.
Coach: Which two lines will you use starting tomorrow?
Coachee: “If we agree today, who still needs to say yes?” and “When do you need this live by?”
Coach: What will you practice today?
Coachee: Asking about the price objection without defending right away.
